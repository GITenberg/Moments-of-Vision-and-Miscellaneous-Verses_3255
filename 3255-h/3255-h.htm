And the rain came down like silken strings<br />
That Swithin&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; Each gutter and spout<br />
Babbled unchecked in the busy way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of witless things:<br />
Nothing to read, nothing to see<br />
Seemed in that room for her and me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Swithin&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p class="poetry">We were irked by the scene, by our own selves;
yes,<br />
For I did not know, nor did she infer<br />
How much there was to read and guess<br />
By her in me, and to see and crown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By me in her.<br />
Wasted were two souls in their prime,<br />
And great was the waste, that July time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the rain came down.</p>

When I was full of wonder, and innocent,<br />
Standing meek-eyed with those of choric bent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While dimming day grew dimmer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the pulpit-glimmer.</p>
<p class="poetry">Much riper in years I met you&mdash;in a
temple<br />
Where summer sunset streamed upon our shapes,<br />
And you spread over me like a gauze that drapes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And flapped from floor to rafters,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet as angels&rsquo;
laughters.</p>
<p class="poetry">But you had been stripped of some of your old

By Monk, or another.&nbsp; Now you wore no frill,<br />

you startled me.&nbsp; But I knew you still,<br />

<p class="poetry">I grew accustomed to you thus.&nbsp; And you
hailed me<br />
Through one who evoked you often.&nbsp; Then at last<br />
Your raiser was borne off, and I mourned you had passed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From my life with your late outsetter;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till I said, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
better!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">But you waylaid me.&nbsp; I rose and went as a
ghost goes,<br />

WORD &ldquo;FAREWELL&rdquo;</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">She</span> looked like a
bird from a cloud<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the clammy lawn,<br />
Moving alone, bare-browed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the dim of dawn.<br />
The candles alight in the room<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For my parting meal<br />
Made all things withoutdoors loom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange, ghostly, unreal.</p>
<p class="poetry">The hour itself was a ghost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And it seemed to me then<br />
As of chances the chance furthermost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I should see her again.<br />
I beheld not where all was so fleet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That a Plan of the past<br />
Which had ruled us from birthtime to meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was in working at last:</p>
<p class="poetry">No prelude did I there perceive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To a drama at all,<br />
Or foreshadow what fortune might weave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From beginnings so small;<br />
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>But I rose
as if quicked by a spur<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I was bound to obey,<br />
And stepped through the casement to her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still alone in the gray.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I am leaving you . . . Farewell!&rdquo;
I said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As I followed her on<br />
By an alley bare boughs overspread;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I soon must be gone!&rdquo;<br />
Even then the scale might have been turned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Against love by a feather,<br />
&mdash;But crimson one cheek of hers burned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When we came in together.</p>

Or is this eve the end of all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such new delight for me?</p>
<p class="poetry">I journey home: the pattern grows<br />

Bitterly have I rued my meanness<br />

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I searched his desk when he
was away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was the likeness&mdash;yes, my own!<br />
Taken when I was the season&rsquo;s fairest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And time-lines all unknown.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled at my image, and put
it back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he went on cherishing it, until<br />
I was chafed that he loved not the me then living,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that past woman still.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, such was my jealousy at

And the portraits of our fore-folk hung around;<br />

&ldquo;Was it not you?&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;A sigh did
sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had not

&nbsp;&nbsp; Framed and glazed there in its place,<br />
Still hearkening; but thenceforth was silentness.</p>

LANIVET, 1872</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> was a stunted
handpost just on the crest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a few feet high:<br />
She was tired, and we stopped in the twilight-time for her
rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the crossways close thereby.</p>
<p class="poetry">She leant back, being so weary, against its
stem,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And laid her arms on its own,<br />
Each open palm stretched out to each end of them,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sad face sideways thrown.</p>
<p class="poetry">Her white-clothed form at this dim-lit cease of
day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made her look as one crucified<br />
In my gaze at her from the midst of the dusty way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hurriedly &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I
cried.</p>
<p class="poetry">I do not think she heard.&nbsp; Loosing thence
she said,<br />

hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the west cloud&rsquo;s murked obscure,<br />
And looking back we could see the handpost still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the solitude of the moor.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;It struck her too,&rdquo; I thought, for
as if afraid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She heavily breathed as we trailed;<br />
Till she said, &ldquo;I did not think how &rsquo;twould look in
the shade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I leant there like one nailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">I, lightly: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in
it.&nbsp; For <i>you</i>, anyhow!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;&ldquo;O I know there is not,&rdquo; said she
. . .<br />
&ldquo;Yet I wonder . . . If no one is bodily crucified now,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; In spirit one may be!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And we dragged on and on, while we seemed to
see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the running of Time&rsquo;s far glass<br />
Her crucified, as she had wondered if she might be<br />

At a shut-in sound of fiddles and tambourines.</p>

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Through the shine of the slippery snow I

As you see the stage from the gallery.&nbsp; And they had no heed

<p class="poetry">After waiting so many a year<br />

I saw them standing crimson-bright<br />

In the churchyard at the moon&rsquo;s half-height,<br />

long dark gallery,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; I thereon asked them why.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Since he made us humble pioneers<br />
Of himself in consciousness of Life&rsquo;s tears,<br />
It needs no mighty prophecy<br />
To tell that what he could mindlessly show<br />
His creatures, he himself will know.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;By some still close-cowled mystery<br />
We have reached feeling faster than he,<br />
But he will overtake us anon,<br />

Played down on his listless form and face,<br />
Bewrapt past knowing to what he was going,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or whence he came.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the band of his hat the journeying boy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had a ticket stuck; and a string<br />
Around his neck bore the key of his box,<br />
That twinkled gleams of the lamp&rsquo;s sad beams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a living thing.</p>
<p class="poetry">What past can be yours, O journeying boy<br />

On all at stake, can undertake<br />

<p class="poetry">Knows your soul a sphere, O journeying boy,<br

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">At</span> the shiver of
morning, a little before the false dawn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moon was at the
window-square,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deedily brooding in deformed decay&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The curve hewn off her cheek as by an adze;<br />
At the shiver of morning a little before the false dawn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So the moon looked in there.</p>
<p class="poetry">Her speechless eyeing reached across the
chamber,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where lay two souls opprest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One a white lady sighing, &ldquo;Why am I
sad!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To him who sighed back, &ldquo;Sad, my Love, am
I!&rdquo;<br />
And speechlessly the old moon conned the chamber,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And these two reft of rest.</p>

there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nought seeming imminent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Something fell sheer, and crashed, and from the
floor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lay glittering at the pair with a shattered gaze,<br
/>
While their large-pupilled vision swept the scene there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the many-eyed thing outleant.</p>
<p class="poetry">With a start they saw that it was an old-time
pier-glass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which had stood on the mantel
near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its silvering blemished,&mdash;yes, as if worn
away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the eyes of the countless dead who had smirked at
it<br />
Ere these two ever knew that old-time pier-glass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And its vague and vacant leer.</p>
<p class="poetry">As he looked, his bride like a moth skimmed
forth, and kneeling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick, with quivering sighs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gathered the pieces under the moon&rsquo;s sly
ray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unwitting as an automaton what she did;<br />
<a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>Till he
entreated, hasting to where she was kneeling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let it stay where it lies!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Long years of sorrow this means!&rdquo;
breathed the lady<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they retired.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she lifted one pale hand across her eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble, Love; it&rsquo;s
nothing,&rdquo; the bridegroom said.<br />
&ldquo;Long years of sorrow for us!&rdquo; murmured the lady,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Or ever this evil pass!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And the Spirits Ironic laughed behind the
wainscot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Spirits of Pity sighed.<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said the Spirits
Ironic, &ldquo;to tickle their minds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a portent of their wedlock&rsquo;s
after-grinds.&rdquo;<br />
And the Spirits of Pity sighed behind the wainscot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a portent we cannot abide!</p>

the day of doom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the drizzling gray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of an English May,<br />
There were few in the railway waiting-room.<br />
About its walls were framed and varnished<br />
Pictures of liners, fly-blown, tarnished.<br />
The table bore a Testament<br />
For travellers&rsquo; reading, if suchwise bent.</p>

on and on,<br />

By some one scrawled, with sundry emendations;<br />

A soldier and wife, with haggard look<br />
Subdued to stone by strong endeavour;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; From a casual word<br />
They were parting as they believed for ever.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But next there came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the eastern flame<br />

Who laughed at the fly-blown pictures there.<br />
&ldquo;Here are the lovely ships that we,<br />
Mother, are by and by going to see!<br />

And the band will play, and the sun will shine!&rdquo;</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
